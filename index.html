        <h1><strong>Useful Plants to know when Hiking</strong></h1>
        <p>This webpage is going to be full of interesting things about various plants you can easily identify when out on a hike.
            They will all be either edible, medicinal, or both. While I will not include <strong>a lot</strong> of detail, I will
            include the most pertinant information and some helpful photos.</p>

          <h2>Top 5 Most Common</h2>

              <h4>Dandelion</h4>
                    <p>The humble and sometimes hated dandelion is one of the most common plants you will likely come across whether 
                        you are in the wilderness or your own yard. What you may not be aware of is that every part of the dandelion is edible!
                        For instance, the bright yellow flowers that you seek to destroy when they dot your yard are actually quite sweet in flavor. 
                        The flowers are <em>especially</em> good when battered and fried. The stems, hollow and useless as they seem are more bland but still provide nourishment.
                        The leaves are bitter and disgusting when they are older and larger but when they are young their flavor is more bland with a bite...if that makes sense.
                        The small leaves, slightly bitter as they may be, can be collected and used as a salad green &quotthis was very common during the Great Depression&quot.
                        The flowers can then be added for both color and sweetness. The roots of dandelion are able to be dried, roasted, ground and prepared much like coffee as a substitute
                        to make your supply of coffee last longer. The only caveat here is that when the plant has finished it's flowering step and those white puffs are on top awaiting to blow into the wind, 
                        don't eat those unless you have fond memories of gagging from the cinnamon challenge.

                <h4>Plantain</h4>
                    <p>No, this is not the larger version of bananas that you find in your grocery store! These plantains are a <strong>VERY</strong> useful plant that can be found almost everywhere, much like 
                        the dandelion. There are two types; broad leaf and narrow leaf. Plantain leaves are edible when young and small, however, its true strength lies in the healing capabilities it has. 
                        The best way to utilize this plant is to chew or crush the leaves and use that paste as a poultice on a wound. This may sound gross, but there are compounds in the plant that can do wonders 
                        on a burn or cut, changing the poultice every 12 hours or so. Using this in this way may or may not, but definitely will, stain your skin green, but it will also speed up the healing process.

                <h4>Yarrow</h4>
                    <p>This dainty little feather-like plant is easily one of the most useful as it can be used to stop bleeding or make a nice tea to break a fever.
                        Yarrow grows at the edges of forests and in open fields usually. The flowers are very similar to other plants, some of which are poisonous, but it can very easily be 
                        distinguished by its unique and feather-like leaves. The leaves can be crushed or chewed and placed on an open and heavily bleeding wound to stop the bleeding (Achilles was 
                        rumored to have used this on his troops during the Battle of Troy) and are quite effective at this task. A gentle tea can be made using the leaves, and the flowers if available, to break a fever 
                        without increasing your core temperature.

                <h4>Pine</h4>
                    <p>The lovely smell of pine trees brings to mind great camping trips and a clean kitchen floor. More importantly, when hiking, a tea of pine needles can be made by steeping needles in off-the-boil water for 4-5 minutes. 
                        This tea is very helpful in makingcold symptoms disappear and is a good mouthwash when you need to get rid of your morning breath after a camping trip. The caveat here is that pine trees can be mistaken for other evergreens if you 
                        are not aware of the differences. Making that mistake coud be very bad as some other evergreens are likely to make you highly sick. Another <strong>very important</strong> thing to remember is that you <strong><em>never</em></strong> 
                        want to boil the needles. Always steep them in the just-off-the-boil water as boiling pine needles can produce a chemical compound similar to paint thinner, which is something most people wouldn't enjoy drinking.

                <h4>Sumac</h4>
                    <p>Now, I know what you're thinking when you read that word, "that's a poison!" But! I have pleasant news for you. While there is one type of sumac that is highly toxic, you aren't likely to encounter it and if you do it's easy to avoid. 
                        There are two types of sumac we are going to show here; staghorn and smooth. Both are helpful plants that grow collections of small red berries, called a drupe, that can be placed into cold water and allowed to essentially steep for a 
                        few hours until an almost apple juice colored liquid has been produced. It will have a very lemonade like taste and the common nicknames for this drink are sumac lemonade or hillbilly lemonade. The process involved is to break or cut off a drupe, 
                        which will look like a blood drop on the end of the limb. Place it inside a container of cold water, preferrably wrapped in a bandana or cheese cloth as the drupes tend to have small hairs on the berries that can come off in your water.
                        Alternatively, you can filter the drink after it has finished its "brew". This sumac lemonade has a ton of vitamin C, much like real lemons. In fact, these same trees grow in the Middle East and the berries are dried and ground into a spice to provide 
                        lemon flavor and vitamin C to dishes. The third type of sumac, the poisonous kind, has white berries so there is no risk of mistaking them for a good one. General rule in the wilderness is that white berries are always bad.
